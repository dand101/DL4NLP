animals_1.txt,animals,"A mammal (from Latin mamma 'breast') is a vertebrate animal of the class Mammalia (). Mammals are characterised by the presence of milk-producing mammary glands for feeding their young, a broad neocortex region of the brain, fur or hair, and three middle ear bones. These characteristics distinguish them from reptiles and birds, from which their ancestors diverged in the Carboniferous Period over 300 million years ago. Around 6,640 extant species of mammals have been described and divided into 27 orders. The study of mammals is called mammalogy. The largest orders of mammals, by number of species, are the rodents, bats, and eulipotyphlans (including hedgehogs, moles and shrews). The next three are the primates (including humans, monkeys and lemurs), the even-toed ungulates (including pigs, bovids and whales), and the Carnivora (including cats, dogs, and seals). Mammals are the only living members of Synapsida; this clade, together with Sauropsida (reptiles and birds), constitutes the larger Amniota clade. Early synapsids are referred to as ""pelycosaurs."" The more advanced therapsids became dominant during the Guadalupian. Mammals originated from cynodonts, an advanced group of therapsids, during the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic. Mammals achieved their modern diversity in the Paleogene and Neogene periods of the Cenozoic era, after the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs, and have been the dominant terrestrial animal group from 66 million years ago to the present.",mammal latin mamma breast vertebrate animal class mammalia mammal characterised presence milk producing mammary gland feeding young broad neocortex region brain fur hair three middle ear bone characteristic distinguish reptile bird ancestor diverged carboniferous period million year ago around extant specie mammal described divided order study mammal called mammalogy largest order mammal number specie rodent bat eulipotyphlans including hedgehog mole shrew next three primate including human monkey lemur even toed ungulate including pig bovid whale carnivora including cat dog seal mammal living member synapsida clade together sauropsida reptile bird constitutes larger amniota clade early synapsid referred pelycosaur advanced therapsid became dominant guadalupian mammal originated cynodont advanced group therapsid late triassic early jurassic mammal achieved modern diversity paleogene neogene period cenozoic era extinction non avian dinosaur dominant terrestrial animal group million year ago present
animals_2.txt,animals,"Birds are a group of warm-blooded theropod dinosaurs constituting the class Aves, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) common ostrich. There are over 11,000 living species and they are split into 44 orders. More than half are passerine or ""perching"" birds. Birds have wings whose development varies according to species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which are modified forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming. The study of birds is called ornithology. Birds evolved from earlier theropods, and thus constitute the only known living dinosaurs. Likewise, birds are considered reptiles in the modern cladistic sense of the term, and their closest living relatives are the crocodilians. Birds are descendants of the primitive avialans (whose members include Archaeopteryx) which first appeared during the Late Jurassic. According to some estimates, modern birds (Neornithes) evolved in the Late Cretaceous or between the Early and Late Cretaceous (100 Ma) and diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago, which killed off the pterosaurs and all non-ornithuran dinosaurs. Many social species preserve knowledge across generations (culture). Birds are social, communicating with visual signals, calls, and songs, and participating in such behaviour as cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators. The vast majority of bird species are socially (but not necessarily sexually) monogamous, usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, and rarely for life. Other species have breeding systems that are polygynous (one male with many females) or, rarely, polyandrous (one female with many males). Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised through sexual reproduction. They are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching.",bird group warm blooded theropod dinosaur constituting class aves characterised feather toothless beaked jaw laying hard shelled egg high metabolic rate four chambered heart strong yet lightweight skeleton bird live worldwide range size cm bee hummingbird ft common ostrich living specie split order half passerine perching bird bird wing whose development varies according specie known group without wing extinct moa elephant bird wing modified forelimb gave bird ability fly although evolution led loss flight bird including ratite penguin diverse endemic island specie digestive respiratory system bird also uniquely adapted flight bird specie aquatic environment particularly seabird waterbird evolved swimming study bird called ornithology bird evolved earlier theropod thus constitute known living dinosaur likewise bird considered reptile modern cladistic sense term closest living relative crocodilian bird descendant primitive avialans whose member include archaeopteryx first appeared late jurassic according estimate modern bird neornithes evolved late cretaceous early late cretaceous diversified dramatically around time cretaceous paleogene extinction event million year ago killed pterosaur non ornithuran dinosaur many social specie preserve knowledge across generation culture bird social communicating visual signal call song participating behaviour cooperative breeding hunting flocking mobbing predator vast majority bird specie socially necessarily sexually monogamous usually one breeding season time sometimes year rarely life specie breeding system polygynous one male many female rarely polyandrous one female many male bird produce offspring laying egg fertilised sexual reproduction usually laid nest incubated parent bird extended period parental care hatching
animals_3.txt,animals,"Reptiles, as commonly defined, are a group of tetrapods with an ectothermic metabolism and amniotic development. Living traditional reptiles comprise four orders: Testudines, Crocodilia, Squamata, and Rhynchocephalia. About 12,000 living species of reptiles are listed in the Reptile Database. The study of the traditional reptile orders, customarily in combination with the study of modern amphibians, is called herpetology. Reptiles have been subject to several conflicting taxonomic definitions. In evolutionary taxonomy, reptiles are gathered together under the class Reptilia ( rep-TIL-ee-ə), which corresponds to common usage. Modern cladistic taxonomy regards that group as paraphyletic, since genetic and paleontological evidence has determined that crocodilians are more closely related to birds (class Aves), members of Dinosauria, than to other living reptiles, and thus birds are nested among reptiles from a phylogenetic perspective. Many cladistic systems therefore redefine Reptilia as a clade (monophyletic group) including birds, though the precise definition of this clade varies between authors. A similar concept is clade Sauropsida, which refers to all amniotes more closely related to modern reptiles than to mammals. The earliest known members of the reptile lineage appeared during the late Carboniferous period, having evolved from advanced reptiliomorph tetrapods which became increasingly adapted to life on dry land. Genetic and fossil data argues that the two largest lineages of reptiles, Archosauromorpha (crocodilians, birds, and kin) and Lepidosauromorpha (lizards, and kin), diverged during the Permian period. In addition to the living reptiles, there are many diverse groups that are now extinct, in some cases due to mass extinction events. In particular, the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event wiped out the pterosaurs, plesiosaurs, and all non-avian dinosaurs alongside many species of crocodyliforms and squamates (e.g., mosasaurs).

animals_4.txt,animals,"Amphibians are ectothermic, anamniotic, four-limbed vertebrate animals that constitute the class Amphibia. In its broadest sense, it is a paraphyletic group encompassing all tetrapods, but excluding the amniotes (tetrapods with an amniotic membrane, such as modern reptiles, birds and mammals). All extant (living) amphibians belong to the monophyletic subclass Lissamphibia, with three living orders: Anura (frogs and toads), Urodela (salamanders), and Gymnophiona (caecilians). Evolved to be mostly semiaquatic, amphibians have adapted to inhabit a wide variety of habitats, with most species living in freshwater, wetland or terrestrial ecosystems (such as riparian woodland, fossorial and even arboreal habitats). Their life cycle typically starts out as aquatic larvae with gills known as tadpoles, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. Young amphibians generally undergo metamorphosis from an aquatic larval form with gills to an air-breathing adult form with lungs. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory interface, and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs even lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to reptiles like lizards, but unlike reptiles and other amniotes, require access to water bodies to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators to habitat conditions; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe. The earliest amphibians evolved in the Devonian period from tetrapodomorph sarcopterygians (lobe-finned fish with articulated limb-like fins) that evolved primitive lungs, which were helpful in adapting to dry land. They diversified and became ecologically dominant during the Carboniferous and Permian periods, but were later displaced in terrestrial environments by early reptiles and basal synapsids (predecessors of mammals). The origin of modern lissamphibians, which first appeared during the Early Triassic, around 250 million years ago, has long been contentious. The most popular hypothesis is that they likely originated from temnospondyls, the most diverse group of prehistoric amphibians, during the Permian period. Another hypothesis is that they emerged from lepospondyls. A fourth group of lissamphibians, the Albanerpetontidae, became extinct around 2 million years ago.",amphibian ectothermic anamniotic four limbed vertebrate animal constitute class amphibia broadest sense paraphyletic group encompassing tetrapod excluding amniote tetrapod amniotic membrane modern reptile bird mammal extant living amphibian belong monophyletic subclass lissamphibia three living order anura frog toad urodela salamander gymnophiona caecilian evolved mostly semiaquatic amphibian adapted inhabit wide variety habitat specie living freshwater wetland terrestrial ecosystem riparian woodland fossorial even arboreal habitat life cycle typically start aquatic larva gill known tadpole specie developed behavioural adaptation bypass young amphibian generally undergo metamorphosis aquatic larval form gill air breathing adult form lung amphibian use skin secondary respiratory interface small terrestrial salamander frog even lack lung rely entirely skin superficially similar reptile like lizard unlike reptile amniote require access water body breed complex reproductive need permeable skin amphibian often ecological indicator habitat condition recent decade dramatic decline amphibian population many specie around globe earliest amphibian evolved devonian period tetrapodomorph sarcopterygians lobe finned fish articulated limb like fin evolved primitive lung helpful adapting dry land diversified became ecologically dominant carboniferous permian period later displaced terrestrial environment early reptile basal synapsid predecessor mammal origin modern lissamphibians first appeared early triassic around million year ago long contentious popular hypothesis likely originated temnospondyls diverse group prehistoric amphibian permian period another hypothesis emerged lepospondyls fourth group lissamphibians albanerpetontidae became extinct around million year ago
animals_5.txt,animals,"A fish is an aquatic, anamniotic, gill-bearing vertebrate animal with swimming fins and a hard skull, but lacking limbs with digits. Fish can be grouped into the more basal jawless fish and the more common jawed fish, the latter including all living cartilaginous and bony fish, as well as the extinct placoderms and acanthodians. In a break from the long tradition of grouping all fish into a single class (Pisces), modern phylogenetics views fish as a paraphyletic group which includes all vertebrates except tetrapods. Most fish are cold-blooded, their body temperature varying with the surrounding water, though some large, active swimmers like the white shark and tuna can maintain a higher core temperature. Many fish can communicate acoustically with each other, such as during courtship displays. The study of fish is known as ichthyology. There are over 33,000 extant species of fish, easily the largest group of vertebrates and more than all species of the other traditional classes, namely amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, combined.

music_1.txt,music,"Classical music generally refers to the art music of the Western world, considered to be distinct from Western folk music or popular music traditions. It is sometimes distinguished as Western classical music, as the term ""classical music"" can also be applied to non-Western art musics. Classical music is often characterized by formality and complexity in its musical form and harmonic organization, particularly with the use of polyphony. Since at least the ninth century, it has been primarily a written tradition, spawning a sophisticated notational system, as well as accompanying literature in analytical, critical, historiographical, musicological and philosophical practices. Rooted in the patronage of churches and royal courts in Europe, surviving early medieval music is chiefly religious, monophonic and vocal, with the music of ancient Greece and Rome influencing its thought and theory. The earliest extant music manuscripts date from the Carolingian Empire (800–887), around the time which Western plainchant gradually unified into what is termed Gregorian chant. Musical centers existed at the Abbey of Saint Gall, the Abbey of Saint Martial and Saint Emmeram's Abbey, while the 11th century saw the development of staff notation and increasing output from medieval music theorists. By the mid-12th century, France became the major European musical center: the religious Notre-Dame school first fully explored organized rhythms and polyphony, while secular music flourished with the troubadour and trouvère traditions led by poet-musician nobles. This culminated in the court-sponsored French ars nova and Italian Trecento, which evolved into ars subtilior, a stylistic movement of extreme rhythmic diversity. Beginning in the early 15th century, Renaissance composers of the influential Franco-Flemish School built on the harmonic principles in the English contenance angloise, bringing choral music to new standards, particularly the mass and motet. Northern Italy soon emerged as the central musical region, where the Roman School engaged in highly sophisticated methods of polyphony in genres such as the madrigal, which inspired the brief English Madrigal School. The Baroque period (1580–1750) saw the relative standardization of common-practice tonality, as well as the increasing importance of musical instruments, which grew into ensembles of considerable size. Italy remained dominant, being the birthplace of opera, the soloist centered concerto genre, the organized sonata form as well as the large scale vocal-centered genres of oratorio and cantata. The fugue technique championed by Johann Sebastian Bach exemplified the Baroque tendency for complexity, and as a reaction the simpler and song-like galant music and empfindsamkeit styles were developed. In the shorter but pivotal Classical period (1730–1820), composers such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Joseph Haydn, and Ludwig van Beethoven created widely admired representatives of absolute music, including symphonies, string quartets and concertos. The subsequent Romantic music (1800–1910) focused instead on programmatic music, for which the art song, symphonic poem and various piano genres were important vessels. During this time virtuosity was celebrated, immensity was encouraged, while philosophy and nationalism were embedded—all aspects that converged in the operas of Richard Wagner.",classical music generally refers art music western world considered distinct western folk music popular music tradition sometimes distinguished western classical music term classical music also applied non western art music classical music often characterized formality complexity musical form harmonic organization particularly use polyphony since least ninth century primarily written tradition spawning sophisticated notational system well accompanying literature analytical critical historiographical musicological philosophical practice rooted patronage church royal court europe surviving early medieval music chiefly religious monophonic vocal music ancient greece rome influencing thought theory earliest extant music manuscript date carolingian empire around time western plainchant gradually unified termed gregorian chant musical center existed abbey saint gall abbey saint martial saint emmeram abbey th century saw development staff notation increasing output medieval music theorist mid th century france became major european musical center religious notre dame school first fully explored organized rhythm polyphony secular music flourished troubadour trouv tradition led poet musician noble culminated court sponsored french ar nova italian trecento evolved ar subtilior stylistic movement extreme rhythmic diversity beginning early th century renaissance composer influential franco flemish school built harmonic principle english contenance angloise bringing choral music new standard particularly mass motet northern italy soon emerged central musical region roman school engaged highly sophisticated method polyphony genre madrigal inspired brief english madrigal school baroque period saw relative standardization common practice tonality well increasing importance musical instrument grew ensemble considerable size italy remained dominant birthplace opera soloist centered concerto genre organized sonata form well large scale vocal centered genre oratorio cantata fugue technique championed johann sebastian bach exemplified baroque tendency complexity reaction simpler song like galant music empfindsamkeit style developed shorter pivotal classical period composer wolfgang amadeus mozart joseph haydn ludwig van beethoven created widely admired representative absolute music including symphony string quartet concerto subsequent romantic music focused instead programmatic music art song symphonic poem various piano genre important vessel time virtuosity celebrated immensity encouraged philosophy nationalism embedded aspect converged opera richard wagner
music_2.txt,music,"Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, Louisiana, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Its roots are in blues, ragtime, European harmony, African rhythmic rituals, spirituals, hymns, marches, vaudeville song, and dance music. Since the 1920s Jazz Age, it has been recognized as a major form of musical expression in traditional and popular music. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, complex chords, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. As jazz spread around the world, it drew on national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to different styles. New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation. However, jazz did not begin as a single musical tradition in New Orleans or elsewhere. In the 1930s, arranged dance-oriented swing big bands, Kansas City jazz (a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style), and gypsy jazz (a style that emphasized musette waltzes) were the prominent styles. Bebop emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging ""musician's music"" which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation. Cool jazz developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines. The mid-1950s saw the emergence of hard bop, which introduced influences from rhythm and blues, gospel, and blues to small groups and particularly to saxophone and piano. Modal jazz developed in the late 1950s, using the mode, or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation, as did free jazz, which explored playing without regular meter, beat and formal structures. Jazz fusion appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, combining jazz improvisation with rock music's rhythms, electric instruments, and highly amplified stage sound. In the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called smooth jazz became successful, garnering significant radio airplay.

music_3.txt,music,"Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated in the United States as ""rock and roll"" in the late 1940s and early 1950s, developing into a range of styles from the mid-1960s, primarily in the United States and United Kingdom. It has its roots in rock and roll, a style that drew from the black musical genres of blues and rhythm and blues, as well as from country music. Rock also drew strongly from genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz and other styles. Rock is typically centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric bass guitar, drums, and one or more singers. Usually, rock is song-based music with a 44 time signature and using a verse–chorus form; however, the genre has become extremely diverse. Like pop music, lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political. Rock was the most popular genre of music in the U.S. and much of the western world from the 1950s up to the 2010s. Rock musicians in the mid-1960s began to advance the album ahead of the single as the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption, with the Beatles at the forefront of this development. Their contributions lent the genre a cultural legitimacy in the mainstream and initiated a rock-informed album era in the music industry for the next several decades. By the late 1960s ""classic rock"" period, a few distinct rock music subgenres had emerged, including hybrids like blues rock, folk rock, country rock, southern rock, raga rock, and jazz rock, which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock, influenced by the countercultural psychedelic and hippie scene. New genres that emerged included progressive rock, which extended artistic elements, heavy metal, which emphasized an aggressive thick sound, and glam rock, which highlighted showmanship and visual style. In the second half of the 1970s, punk rock reacted by producing stripped-down, energetic social and political critiques. Punk was an influence in the 1980s on new wave, post-punk and eventually alternative rock.",rock music genre popular music originated united state rock roll late early developing range style mid primarily united state united kingdom root rock roll style drew black musical genre blue rhythm blue well country music rock also drew strongly genre electric blue folk incorporated influence jazz style rock typically centered electric guitar usually part rock group electric bass guitar drum one singer usually rock song based music time signature using verse chorus form however genre become extremely diverse like pop music lyric often stress romantic love also address wide variety theme frequently social political rock popular genre music much western world rock musician mid began advance album ahead single dominant form recorded music expression consumption beatles forefront development contribution lent genre cultural legitimacy mainstream initiated rock informed album era music industry next several decade late classic rock period distinct rock music subgenres emerged including hybrid like blue rock folk rock country rock southern rock raga rock jazz rock contributed development psychedelic rock influenced countercultural psychedelic hippie scene new genre emerged included progressive rock extended artistic element heavy metal emphasized aggressive thick sound glam rock highlighted showmanship visual style second half punk rock reacted producing stripped energetic social political critique punk influence new wave post punk eventually alternative rock
music_4.txt,music,"Hip-hop (also known as rap music or simply rap) is a popular music genre that emerged in the early 1970s alongside an associated subculture in the African-American and Latino communities of New York City. The musical style is characterized by the synthesis of a wide range of techniques, but rapping is frequent enough that it has become a defining characteristic. Other key markers of the genre are the disc jockey (DJ), turntablism, scratching, beatboxing, and instrumental tracks. Cultural interchange has always been central to the hip-hop genre; it simultaneously borrows from its social environment while commenting on it. The hip-hop genre and culture emerged from block parties in ethnic minority neighborhoods of New York City, particularly the Bronx. DJs began expanding the instrumental breaks of popular records when they noticed how excited it would make the crowds. The extended breaks provided a platform for break dancers and rappers. These breakbeats enabled the subsequent evolution of the hip-hop style. Many of the records used were disco due to its popularity at the time. This disco-inflected music was originally known as disco-rap and later described as ""old-school hip-hop"". In the late 1980s and 1990s, hip-hop began to diversify as electro music started to inform a style later known as ""new-school hip-hop"". The transition between the mid-1980s and 1990s became known as ""hip-hop's golden age"", as the genre earned widespread critical acclaim and generated massive sales. Across the United States, several regional scenes emerged, most notably on the East and West Coasts, as well as in the South, which included the Houston, Atlanta and Memphis rap scenes. This era saw the emergence of popular styles such as G-funk, boom bap and gangsta rap, as well as more experimental genres like alternative hip-hop and jazz rap, which stemmed from the Native Tongues movement, alongside progressive and conscious hip-hop.",hip hop also known rap music simply rap popular music genre emerged early alongside associated subculture african american latino community new york city musical style characterized synthesis wide range technique rapping frequent enough become defining characteristic key marker genre disc jockey dj turntablism scratching beatboxing instrumental track cultural interchange always central hip hop genre simultaneously borrows social environment commenting hip hop genre culture emerged block party ethnic minority neighborhood new york city particularly bronx dj began expanding instrumental break popular record noticed excited would make crowd extended break provided platform break dancer rapper breakbeats enabled subsequent evolution hip hop style many record used disco due popularity time disco inflected music originally known disco rap later described old school hip hop late hip hop began diversify electro music started inform style later known new school hip hop transition mid became known hip hop golden age genre earned widespread critical acclaim generated massive sale across united state several regional scene emerged notably east west coast well south included houston atlanta memphis rap scene era saw emergence popular style funk boom bap gangsta rap well experimental genre like alternative hip hop jazz rap stemmed native tongue movement alongside progressive conscious hip hop
music_5.txt,music,"Electronic music broadly is a group of music genres that employ electronic musical instruments, circuitry-based music technology and software, or general-purpose electronics (such as personal computers) in its creation. It includes both music made using electronic and electromechanical means (electroacoustic music). Pure electronic instruments depend entirely on circuitry-based sound generation, for instance using devices such as an electronic oscillator, theremin, or synthesizer: no acoustic waves need to be previously generated by mechanical means and then converted into electrical signals. On the other hand, electromechanical instruments have mechanical parts such as strings or hammers that generate the sound waves, together with electric elements including magnetic pickups, power amplifiers and loudspeakers that convert the acoustic waves into electrical signals, process them and convert them back into sound waves. Such electromechanical devices include the telharmonium, Hammond organ, electric piano and electric guitar. The first electronic musical devices were developed at the end of the 19th century. During the 1920s and 1930s, some electronic instruments were introduced and the first compositions featuring them were written. By the 1940s, magnetic audio tape allowed musicians to tape sounds and then modify them by changing the tape speed or direction, leading to the development of electroacoustic tape music in the 1940s in Egypt and France. Musique concrète, created in Paris in 1948, was based on editing together recorded fragments of natural and industrial sounds. Music produced solely from electronic generators was first produced in Germany in 1953 by Karlheinz Stockhausen. Electronic music was also created in Japan and the United States beginning in the 1950s and algorithmic composition with computers was first demonstrated in the same decade. During the 1960s, digital computer music was pioneered, innovation in live electronics took place, and Japanese electronic musical instruments began to influence the music industry. In the early 1970s, Moog synthesizers and drum machines helped popularize synthesized electronic music. The 1970s also saw electronic music begin to have a significant influence on popular music, with the adoption of polyphonic synthesizers, electronic drums, drum machines, and turntables, through the emergence of genres such as disco, krautrock, new wave, synth-pop, hip hop and electronic dance music (EDM). In the early 1980s, mass-produced digital synthesizers such as the Yamaha DX7 became popular which saw development of the MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface). In the same decade, with a greater reliance on synthesizers and the adoption of programmable drum machines, electronic popular music came to the fore. During the 1990s, with the proliferation of increasingly affordable music technology, electronic music production became an established part of popular culture.

technology_3.txt,technology,"In computer science, computer engineering, and telecommunications, a network is a group of communicating computers and peripherals known as hosts, which communicate data to other hosts via communication protocols, as facilitated by networking hardware. Within a computer network, hosts are identified by network addresses, which allow network software such as the Internet Protocol to locate and identify hosts. Hosts may also have hostnames, memorable labels for the host nodes, which can be mapped to a network address using a hosts file or a name server such as Domain Name Service. The physical medium that supports information exchange includes wired media like copper cables, optical fibers, and wireless radio-frequency media. The arrangement of hosts and hardware within a network architecture is known as the network topology. The first computer network was created in 1940 when George Stibitz connected a terminal at Dartmouth to his Complex Number Calculator at Bell Labs in New York. Today, almost all computers are connected to a computer network, such as the global Internet or embedded networks such as those found in many modern electronic devices. Many applications have only limited functionality unless they are connected to a network. Networks support applications and services, such as access to the World Wide Web, digital video and audio, application and storage servers, printers, and email and instant messaging applications.",computer science computer engineering telecommunication network group communicating computer peripheral known host communicate data host via communication protocol facilitated networking hardware within computer network host identified network address allow network software internet protocol locate identify host host may also hostnames memorable label host node mapped network address using host file name server domain name service physical medium support information exchange includes wired medium like copper cable optical fiber wireless radio frequency medium arrangement host hardware within network architecture known network topology first computer network created george stibitz connected terminal dartmouth complex number calculator bell lab new york today almost computer connected computer network global internet embedded network found many modern electronic device many application limited functionality unless connected network network support application service access world wide web digital video audio application storage server printer email instant messaging application
technology_4.txt,technology,"Computer security (also cybersecurity, digital security, or information technology (IT) security) is a subdiscipline within the field of information security. It focuses on protecting computer software, systems, and networks from threats that can lead to unauthorized information disclosure, theft or damage to hardware, software, or data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide. The growing significance of computer insecurity reflects the increasing dependence on computer systems, the Internet, and evolving wireless network standards. This reliance has expanded with the proliferation of smart devices, including smartphones, televisions, and other components of the Internet of things (IoT). As digital infrastructure becomes more embedded in everyday life, cybersecurity has emerged as a critical concern. The complexity of modern information systems—and the societal functions they underpin—has introduced new vulnerabilities. Systems that manage essential services, such as power grids, electoral processes, and finance, are particularly sensitive to security breaches.",computer security also cybersecurity digital security information technology security subdiscipline within field information security focus protecting computer software system network threat lead unauthorized information disclosure theft damage hardware software data well disruption misdirection service provide growing significance computer insecurity reflects increasing dependence computer system internet evolving wireless network standard reliance expanded proliferation smart device including smartphones television component internet thing iot digital infrastructure becomes embedded everyday life cybersecurity emerged critical concern complexity modern information system societal function underpin introduced new vulnerability system manage essential service power grid electoral process finance particularly sensitive security breach
technology_5.txt,technology,"The Internet of Things (IoT) describes physical objects that are embedded with sensors, processing ability, software, and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the internet or other communication networks. The IoT encompasses electronics, communication, and computer science engineering. ""Internet of Things"" has been considered a misnomer because devices do not need to be connected to the public internet; they only need to be connected to a network and be individually addressable. The field has evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, including ubiquitous computing, commodity sensors, increasingly powerful embedded systems, and machine learning. Traditional fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, and control systems independently and collectively enable the Internet of Things. While in the consumer market, IoT technology is most synonymous with ""smart home"" products—including devices and appliances like thermostats and smart speakers—the technology's largest applications are in the business and industrial sectors. Commercial asset tracking and fleet management represent the largest single application of IoT, accounting for 22% of the total market, driven by the need to monitor mobile assets like vehicles and shipping containers. Other major applications include industrial monitoring, smart metering in utilities, and connected healthcare.",internet thing iot describes physical object embedded sensor processing ability software technology connect exchange data device system internet communication network iot encompasses electronics communication computer science engineering internet thing considered misnomer device need connected public internet need connected network individually addressable field evolved due convergence multiple technology including ubiquitous computing commodity sensor increasingly powerful embedded system machine learning traditional field embedded system wireless sensor network control system independently collectively enable internet thing consumer market iot technology synonymous smart home product including device appliance like thermostat smart speaker technology largest application business industrial sector commercial asset tracking fleet management represent largest single application iot accounting total market driven need monitor mobile asset like vehicle shipping container major application include industrial monitoring smart metering utility connected healthcare
